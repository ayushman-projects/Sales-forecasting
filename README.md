# Sales-forecasting
Sales forecasting is an essential technique in business to estimate future sales trends. By analyzing historical sales data, businesses can make informed decisions about inventory management, financial planning, and strategy development. Machine learning models, particularly time series analysis, play a significant role in improving forecasting accuracy. This project focuses on sales analysis and forecasting for a retail store using machine learning models. The primary goal is to predict sales trends for the year 2025 using historical inventory and sales data. The ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model is employed to perform sales forecasting.
